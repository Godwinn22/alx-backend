# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

==========================

# Description

------------
This is a JavaScript implementation of a queuing system. It includes classes for `Queue`, `Node
`, and `PriorityQueue`. The `Queue` class represents a basic First-In-First-Out (
	FIFO) queue, while the `PriorityQueue` class extends the `Queue` class to implement
	a priority queue.
